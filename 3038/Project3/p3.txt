turnin code:  py_p3


Write a python3 module named p3mod.py which can be imported and used as
in the sample p3rmb.py program.

The module should provide the function named read_one_fasta_entry which
takes an open file as an argument.  That function *must* be implemented
as a generator which will, on each invocation, return a single entry
from a fasta file (e.g. p3sampin).

Note1:  the ">" symbol is *NOT* part of the pegid.
Note2:  the pegid is terminated by the first whitespace on the line.

To test, I will run p3rmb.py multiple times with various inputs.
Each test will import your p3mod.py module.

Use turnin to submit only your python source file.
