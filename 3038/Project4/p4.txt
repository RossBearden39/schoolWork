turnin code:  py_p4


Write a python3 program that reads a file of sequence ids and sequences
from the file named as the only command-line argument.  All test input
files will be some subset of the lines in p4sampin.  Note that p4sampin
has each id and its sequence on the same line.

Compare all pairs of lines and print out the seqids for the two sequences
that have the Longest Common Substring.  There is a small function in
p4starter.py which you should use to perform that calculation for each
pair of strings.

Note: Your program should do a simple all-to-all comparison, i.e each
sequence should be compared against every other sequence.  The program
does not need to skip comparisons that have already been done by any
process.

Use some facility of your choice from the python3 multiprocessing module
to perform pair-wise checks in parallel.  A run might look like this:

    ./p4.py 4 inputfilename

where the 4 is the number of worker processes that should do the
comparisons.  So, if you have a manager process, then you will add 4
more, but if your main thread participates in the work, then you will
only add 3 more.  It is valid to assume that the number of workers
requested on the command-line will range between 1 and 8, inclusive.
Split the work evenly among the processes to obtain a good speed-up.

If these two sequences had the maximum common string of all in p4sampin:

    seq.1269
    seq.1623

and if their longest common substring were 104 bytes, then you would
print this:

    104  seq.1269  seq.1623
